# Frontend Celfocus React test

List of companies with their respective phone numbers.

# Prerequisites
I used Yarn as package manager, so you can run `yarn` to install all dependencies needed to run the project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn api`

Runs the REST API based on [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/) .\
Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it in your browser.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

You can build the project, but it's not needed to run it.
